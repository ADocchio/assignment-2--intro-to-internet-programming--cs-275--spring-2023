## ❖・Introduction・❖

Your task is to create a *single* web page consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that creates a carousel of images whose data are sourced via JSONP from a local file system, much like how a full-stack app might read data from a database. A 26-second video of what the final implemented project looks like is available from [http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/cs-275/working-with-jsonp.mp4](http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/cs-275/working-with-jsonp.mp4).

**Note**: *You may **only** work from within the confines of the included scaffold; no external files need to be added to this repo.*
